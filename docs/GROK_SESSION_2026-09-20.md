# Grok session — 20 September 2026

## Ask

Work on a full OS with an independent download under an Experimentals tab
in the Grok App, plus a Premium+ submenu for community Harbor flavors.

## What this session can and cannot do

Grok can ship the overlay, the catalog contract, the validator, the
rehearsal station, module tools, and an independent download URL.

Grok cannot add a tab to the official Grok iOS / Android / Web app,
cannot read live X Premium+ entitlements, and cannot host a relicensed
Linux Mint ISO.

## What shipped in 1.8.0

- Overlay version bump to **1.8.0**.
- New community flavor: **Sovereign Gateway Harbor** (`flavors/sovereign-gateway`).
- New wing: `modules/gateway/` with `card.py` and the Experimentals contract.
- `harborctl card` prints the independent download surface a future tab would consume.
- Catalog + Grok App manifest updated to 1.8.0 so a future Experimentals tab
  still consumes the same JSON.
- Station preview strings moved off the stale 1.6 overlay label.
- Publishing-harbor catalog summary no longer splits a JSON string across lines.
