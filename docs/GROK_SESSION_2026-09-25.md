# Grok session — 25 September 2026

## Ask

Work on a full OS with an independent download under an Experimentals tab
in the Grok App, plus a Premium+ submenu for community Harbor flavors.

## What this session can and cannot do

Grok can ship the overlay, the catalog contract, the validator, the
rehearsal station, the flavor-pack builder, module tools, a personal ISO
bake checklist, and an independent download URL.

Grok cannot add a tab to the official Grok iOS / Android / Web app,
cannot read live X Premium+ entitlements, and cannot host a relicensed
Linux Mint ISO.

## What shipped in 1.12.0

- Overlay version bump to **1.12.0**.
- `scripts/pack-flavor.sh` + `harborctl pack-flavor` produce the Premium+
  upload artifact (`harbor-flavor-<id>-<version>.zip`, SHA-256, 50 MiB cap).
- `harborctl app-contract` prints the proposed Grok App IA and live URLs.
- Self-contained Experimentals station now embeds the catalog, searches
  flavors, and copies download links without depending on raw.githubusercontent.
- Overlay `pack` writes `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Visualizer metrics report the live overlay version from `VERSION`.
