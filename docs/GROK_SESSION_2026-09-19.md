# Grok session — 19 September 2026

## Ask

Work on a full OS with an independent download under an Experimentals tab
in the Grok App, plus a Premium+ submenu for community Harbor flavors.

## What this session can and cannot do

Grok can ship the overlay, the catalog contract, the validator, the
rehearsal station, module tools, and an independent download URL.

Grok cannot add a tab to the official Grok iOS / Android / Web app,
cannot read live X Premium+ entitlements, and cannot host a relicensed
Linux Mint ISO.

## What shipped in 1.7.0

- Overlay version bump to **1.7.0**.
- New community flavor: **Archives Harbor** (`flavors/archives-harbor`).
- Archives tool: `python3 modules/archives/remember.py "stone that should remain"`.
- Publishing stager: `python3 modules/publishing/stage.py "draft title"`.
- `harborctl status` prints version, flavor, wings, and ports without leaking keys.
- Visualizer `/api/metrics` and `/api/empire` now read `VERSION` instead of a stale 1.5 string.
- Catalog + Grok App manifest updated so a future Experimentals tab still
  consumes the same JSON.
